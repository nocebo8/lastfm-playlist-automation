# lastfm-playlist-automation

This repository automatically generates a playlist from Last.fm history.

### Manual workflow usage

When triggering the workflow manually (`Workflow Dispatch`), you'll be
prompted for the time period used to fetch your top tracks. You can
select one of the following options:

- `1day`
- `7day`
- `1month`
- `6month`

If you leave the input empty, `6month` will be used by default.
